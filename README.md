# EnchantmentsPlusMinus
Custom enchants for Prison, Factions, Skyblock and Survival servers

# Overview
Enchantments+- is a custom enchantment plugin that is made for Prison and PVP servers. With enchants ranging from Token-giving blocks to explosive pickaxes, Enchantments+- is the solution to your custom enchanting needs.

# Features
Easily customizable custom enchants  
A special currency called Tokens that can be easily integrated with voting systems, crate systems, etc  
An easy-to-use API to make your own custom enchants  

# Misc
The plugin is in a beta stage, which means there will be many bugs.  
Enchantments+- only works on versions 1.13+ due to the different enchantment system in 1.12 and below. Maybe after the beta stage I work on making Enchantments+- 1.12 compatible.  
Enchantments+- doesn't really mean anything. Really, it just sounds cool.  
Enjoy the plugin!
